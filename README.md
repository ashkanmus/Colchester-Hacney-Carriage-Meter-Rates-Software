# Colchester Hackney Carriage Meter Rates Software

## Background

I used to drive a Hackney carriage alongside my university studies. 
When I was new to the job, I struggled with passengers asking for upfront fare estimates, which often led to confusion or frustration. To solve this problem.
I decided to build a software that could calculate and display accurate fare estimates for Hackney carriage drivers. 
Now, many Hackney carriage drivers in Colchester rely on this tool to provide transparent and reliable fare estimates to their passengers.

## Features

- **Fare Estimate**: Displays the rates for different taxi fares.
- **Distance and Duration**: Shows the distance and estimated duration of the trip.
- **Customizable Rates**: Allows easy updates to the rates for different taxi services.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Google Maps API**: For calculating distances and displaying the route.
- **CSS/HTML**: For styling and structuring the web app.
